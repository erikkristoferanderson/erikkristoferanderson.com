Hello, world, and welcome to my corner of the internet where science meets storytelling.

I created this webpage to showcase my career as an author and editor.

From being encouraged to read fiction as a child to delving in to the mysteries of photosynthesis as an overwhelmed graduate student I have been both byoued and sunk by stores. The stories I consumed laid out what was possible, while the stories I told myself sometimes held me back.

Now I'm in a season of my life where I will be telling stories as an author and helping others tell their stories as an editor. As a writer, I'm drawn to the endless "what ifs" of science fiction. As an editor, I'm dedicated to bringing a scientist's eye to your world building.

This site will serve as a hub for my writing and editorial work. You can expect to find writing samples, links to my published work, and commentary on science fiction and the editorial process.

I believe the universe is finite but the possibiliies within it are infinite. Let's create something new together.
